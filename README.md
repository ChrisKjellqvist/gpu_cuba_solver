# Naive GPU Solver for CUBA benchmark

Benchmark originates from Vogel and Abbot 2005 paper:
Vogels,  T.  P.,  &  Abbott,  L.  F.  (2005).  Signal  propagation
andlogic gating in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons.Journal of
Neuroscience, 25, 10786â€“10795.

Using for potential baseline in current work.
